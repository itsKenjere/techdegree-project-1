        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've traveled to lots of different places and have worked in a family business for years. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a landscaper / gardener and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
        <p>I grew up on social media at a very young age and ever since then I was influenced by memes, YouTube, & Business. From their I grown a small following on multiple social media accounts and learned how to leverage my followers and create my own websites at a young age. I've had videos get a lot of views and some not do so well but with this learning process it helped me understand the internet and it's algorithm.</p>
        <p>The best part about being on the internet is when I created my own store for the first time and even though I didn't get many customers I did have traffic coming to my website so I learned what was driving customers away and how to make them feel more safe and secure on a unknow website.</p>
        <p>Long story short I have some business smarts in social media marketing and I intend to use my new upcoming clients in web development.</p>
